## 👋 Hey there, welcome to my GitHub!   

I’m **Dewansh Vishwakarma**, a **Data Analyst** who loves turning messy data into meaningful insights.

I recently completed my **Master of Computer Applications (MCA)**, where I developed a strong interest in **data analytics** and its power to solve real-world problems.

Through **three Data Science internships**, I gained hands-on experience working with **Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI** — cleaning data, creating dashboards, and uncovering insights that drive better decisions.  

I’m now focused on applying my skills to impactful projects, learning from real-world challenges, and growing as a data professional.
